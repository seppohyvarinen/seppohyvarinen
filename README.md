### Hi there 👋 I am Seppo Hyvärinen, a final year student at Tampere University of Applied Sciences. <br>
I am a coding enthusiast and interested in mobile- and web development (both frontend and backend). <br>
For mobile, I develop with Swift and Kotlin. Currently I'm doing internship as iOS App Developer<br>
React is my framework of choice for frontend and I usually run backends with Node.js.<br>

Next in line for learning is deepening my knowledge of React (Redux and other state management solutions specifically) <br>
and also getting to know TypeScript.
