### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Seppo HyvÃ¤rinen, a third year student at Tampere University of Applied Sciences. <br>
I am a JavaScript enthusiast and interested in web development (both frontend and backend) and mobile development, preferably with Android. <br>
React is my framework of choice for frontend and I usually run backends with Node.js.<br>
For Android development I like to use Kotlin and Java <br>
Next in line for learning is deepening my knowledge of React (Redux and other state management solutions specifically) <br>
and also getting to know TypeScript.
